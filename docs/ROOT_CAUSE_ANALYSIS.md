# 🔍 Root Cause Analysis: DeploymentNotFound Error

## Issue Summary
After multiple deployment attempts (runs #32-38), we identified the root cause of the persistent "DeploymentNotFound" error that was preventing successful Azure infrastructure deployment.

## Root Cause Identified
**Problem**: The Azure CLI command was combining deployment creation and output querying in a single command:
```bash
az deployment group create --query 'properties.outputs' --output json
```

**Why this failed**: 
- The `--query 'properties.outputs'` flag tries to immediately query the deployment outputs
- Azure CLI was unable to find the deployment to query from, even though the deployment name was correctly provided
- This created a race condition where the query executed before the deployment was properly tracked

## Solution Applied (Run #39)
**Fix**: Separated deployment creation from output retrieval:

1. **Deploy without querying outputs**:
   ```bash
   az deployment group create \
     --name "$DEPLOYMENT_NAME" \
     [... parameters ...] \
     --verbose
   ```

2. **Retrieve outputs after deployment completes**:
   ```bash
   az deployment group show \
     --name "$DEPLOYMENT_NAME" \
     --query 'properties.outputs' \
     --output json
   ```

## Evidence from Run #38 Logs
- ✅ **Validation succeeded**: All 9 deployments and 16 resources validated successfully
- ✅ **Deployment started**: Named `todolist-dev-20250812-082028`
- ❌ **Query failed**: `{"error":{"code":"DeploymentNotFound","message":"Deployment 'todolist-dev-20250812-082028' could not be found."}}`

## Resources Validated Successfully
The validation in run #38 confirmed all components are correctly configured:

### Module Deployments
- ✅ log-analytics-deployment
- ✅ app-insights-deployment  
- ✅ key-vault-deployment
- ✅ container-registry-deployment
- ✅ postgresql-deployment
- ✅ container-apps-env-deployment
- ✅ key-vault-secrets-deployment
- ✅ container-app-deployment
- ✅ rbac-assignments-deployment

### Azure Resources
- ✅ Log Analytics Workspace: `todolist-dev-logs`
- ✅ Key Vault: `kvdevs3xonmbz`
- ✅ Container Registry: `todolistdevacrs3xonmbzqmkzy`
- ✅ PostgreSQL Server: `todolist-dev-db`
- ✅ PostgreSQL Database: `todolistdb`
- ✅ Firewall Rules: `AllowAzureServices`

## Expected Outcome (Run #39)
With the separated deployment approach:
1. 🎯 **Infrastructure deployment will complete successfully**
2. 🎯 **All Azure resources will be provisioned**
3. 🎯 **Output values will be correctly retrieved**
4. 🎯 **Container image build and deployment will proceed**

## Technical Learning
- Azure CLI `--query` parameter on `az deployment group create` can cause race conditions
- Separating concerns (deploy vs. query) provides more reliable deployments
- Validation success indicates template correctness but doesn't guarantee deployment command execution
