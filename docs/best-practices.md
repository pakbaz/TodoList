# Azure Best Practices for .NET Blazor TodoList Application

## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the best practices for deploying a .NET 9 Blazor Server application with PostgreSQL database to Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Bicep templates and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## Infrastructure Best Practices

### Azure Container Apps

1. **Serverless Container Hosting**
   - Use Azure Container Apps for auto-scaling serverless container hosting
   - Enable consumption-based pricing with scale-to-zero capabilities
   - Configure session affinity for Blazor Server applications (sticky sessions)
   - Use system-assigned managed identity for secure service-to-service communication

2. **Container Configuration**
   - Use multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized container images
   - Run containers as non-root user for security
   - Configure health probes (liveness, readiness, startup)
   - Set appropriate resource limits (CPU and memory)

3. **Networking & Security**
   - Use private networking with VNet integration when possible
   - Configure ingress settings for external access
   - Implement IP restrictions for additional security
   - Enable HTTPS with custom domain bindings

### Database (Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server)

1. **Configuration**
   - Use Flexible Server for better performance and features
   - Enable high availability with zone redundancy for production
   - Configure automated backups with geo-redundancy
   - Use Burstable tier for development, General Purpose for production

2. **Security**
   - Disable public network access and use private endpoints
   - Enable Azure AD authentication alongside PostgreSQL authentication
   - Use SSL/TLS encryption for connections
   - Store connection strings in Azure Key Vault

3. **Performance**
   - Configure appropriate compute tier based on workload
   - Enable storage auto-grow
   - Monitor performance metrics and adjust as needed

### Azure Container Registry (ACR)

1. **Image Management**
   - Use Azure Container Registry for private container images
   - Enable admin user for CI/CD authentication
   - Configure geo-replication for global deployments
   - Implement image scanning for security vulnerabilities

2. **Access Control**
   - Use managed identity for container apps to pull images
   - Configure RBAC for developers and CI/CD pipelines
   - Enable anonymous pull for public images if needed

### Security Best Practices

1. **Identity & Access Management**
   - Use system-assigned managed identities where possible
   - Implement least privilege access principles
   - Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management
   - Enable Azure AD authentication for services

2. **Network Security**
   - Use private endpoints for database connectivity
   - Implement network security groups and firewall rules
   - Enable VNet integration for container apps
   - Use Application Gateway for advanced routing and WAF

3. **Data Protection**
   - Enable encryption at rest for all services
   - Use TLS 1.2+ for all connections
   - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
   - Configure data retention policies

### Monitoring & Observability

1. **Application Insights**
   - Enable Application Insights for application monitoring
   - Configure custom telemetry and metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical application events
   - Monitor performance and availability

2. **Azure Monitor**
   - Use Azure Monitor for infrastructure monitoring
   - Configure Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
   - Set up dashboards for operational visibility
   - Implement automated scaling based on metrics

### CI/CD Best Practices

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for keyless authentication
   - Implement environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Use deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments
   - Implement automated testing in pipelines

2. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Use Bicep templates for resource provisioning
   - Implement modular and reusable templates
   - Use parameter files for environment-specific configurations
   - Version control all infrastructure code

3. **Security in CI/CD**
   - Store secrets in GitHub Secrets or Azure Key Vault
   - Use short-lived tokens and credentials rotation
   - Implement security scanning in pipelines
   - Follow least privilege principles for service principals

## Performance Optimization

1. **Container Apps Scaling**
   - Configure appropriate scaling rules (HTTP, CPU, memory)
   - Set minimum and maximum replica counts
   - Use scale-to-zero for cost optimization in non-production
   - Monitor scaling events and adjust thresholds

2. **Database Performance**
   - Implement connection pooling in application
   - Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads
   - Monitor and optimize slow queries
   - Configure appropriate backup and maintenance windows

3. **Content Delivery**
   - Use Azure CDN for static assets
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize image and asset sizes
   - Enable compression for better performance

## Cost Optimization

1. **Resource Sizing**
   - Start with smaller SKUs and scale up as needed
   - Use Burstable database tiers for development
   - Enable auto-shutdown for non-production environments
   - Monitor resource utilization and right-size accordingly

2. **Automation**
   - Implement automated start/stop schedules for dev environments
   - Use Azure Policy for cost governance
   - Set up budget alerts and spending limits
   - Regular review and optimization of resource usage

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Configure automated database backups
   - Implement geo-redundant storage for critical data
   - Test backup and restore procedures regularly
   - Document recovery time and point objectives (RTO/RPO)

2. **High Availability**
   - Use availability zones for critical services
   - Implement multi-region deployments for DR
   - Configure health checks and automated failover
   - Test disaster recovery procedures

## Compliance & Governance

1. **Azure Policy**
   - Implement resource tagging standards
   - Enforce security and compliance policies
   - Monitor policy compliance and violations
   - Use Azure Blueprints for standardized deployments

2. **Auditing & Compliance**
   - Enable audit logging for all services
   - Implement compliance frameworks (SOC, ISO, etc.)
   - Regular security assessments and penetration testing
   - Document security and compliance procedures
